<h1> Day 2 begins </h2>
<h2> Subtopics <h/2>
<h3> What I covered in the previous day</h3>
<p> I have learnt the basic HTML syntax, the layout of a HTML file, writing comments in HTML and that HTML is a case insensitive language. </p>
<h4> Covered today </h4>
<p> The body tag, hyperlink attribute, 6 heading tags, paragraph tag, image tag, <b> bold </b>, <i> italic </i> and <u> underlined</u> tags</p>
<pre> 
It is also worth noting that the pre 
			tag 	creates content 
	that is rendered	 on with 
    all the spaces as written by the 
 author.
