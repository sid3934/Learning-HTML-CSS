<font size = "70">
<pre>Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.His mother, Purnima Sharma, is from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grand-
parents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends.He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma. </pre> </font>
<hr>
<font size="75"><h2> Youth and domestic first class career:</h2></font>
<font size="70">
<pre>Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He scored 57 and 22 as India won by 3 wickets. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the 2006â€“07 season and scored 205 off 267 balls against Gujarat.
Mumbai went on to win the tournament with Sharma scoring a half-century (57) in his second innings in the final against Bengal. </pre> </font>

<font size="75"><h2> Playing style:</h2></font>
<font size="70">
<pre>Sharma is an aggressive batsman but plays with style and elegance. He is usually an opening batsman in limited overs cricket, but has played most of his Test cricket  as a middle-order batsman. In limited overs cricket, Sharma is widely recognised as 
one of the format's most outstanding batsmen. Sunil Gavaskar considers Sharma to have a batting style similar to those of Virender Sehwag and Viv Richards. In his column for The Times of India in November 2018, Gavaskar said:
	<i>The standout performer in both the limited overs series and the T20 series has been Rohit Sharma. Like Virender Sehwag before him, he is unstoppable once he gets going and like Viru he has an appetite for big hundreds. When Viru used to get out 
	looking to hit another delivery out of the park, there used to be consternation around the ground, just like it is when Rohit gets out to a seemingly casual shot. If Rohit can turn his white ball exploits into red ball cricket, he will be the most 
	destructive batsman in the world after Viv Richards and Virender Sehwag.</i></pre> </font>

<font size = "75"> <h2> Achievements:</h2> </font>
<font size="70">
<pre>Sharma holds the world record for the highest individual score by a batsman playing in a one-day international match, having scored 264 against Sri Lanka at  Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on 13 November 2014. He is the only player to have scored three double-
centuries in this form of international cricket. In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC). During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five-centuries 
in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup. On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman. In the same series, he broke Shimron 
Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.</pre></font>
