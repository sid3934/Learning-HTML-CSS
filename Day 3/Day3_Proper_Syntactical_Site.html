Body. 2 breaks down has 2.1 header, 2.2 Main 2.3 Footer. 2.1 may contain a navigation. <br> 2.2 breaks down as 2.2.1 section, 2.2.2 article and if needed 2.2.3 aside. <br> Having a proper syntax for a webpage boosts user experience and also enhances the page's visibility for a search engine.</p></article>
