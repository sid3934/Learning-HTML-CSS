        <article><p>The body that is rendered on the browser should have the right syntax. Having a proper header followed by a main tag which consists of heading, paragraph & various other elements and a footer makes the right syntax for a webpage. Right syntax boosts user experience and also enhances the page's visibility for a search engine.</p></article>
